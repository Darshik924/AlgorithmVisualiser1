# Project-Algorithm-Visualiser
Project was assigned to us for winter 2025 by our seniors in CSESA..

--> This project features an Algorithm Visualiser (mainly sorting algorithms) which people may have difficult to understand at first time.

--> Proper visual animations and colour changes will help you better in visualization the next time you write that code it will be easier.

### Here's a brief idea about what i made-->

1)  Sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Quick Sort
2)  The Site asks you to enter a size of the array (numbers) followed by entering the array elements (in any order, which will get sorted later).
3)  Now after you click Go you will be able to watch the bars (or boxes) animate change colour logically and sorted themselves using the algorithm that you selected.
